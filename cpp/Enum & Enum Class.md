1.  **Scope**:
    
    -   **enum**: The enumeration values are in the scope that contains the enum. This means there's a potential for name clashes.

    ```c++
    enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; 
    // RED, GREEN, BLUE are all accessible here.
	```
       
        
    -   **enum class**: The enumeration values are scoped within the enum class. This avoids potential naming conflicts.
        

	 ```c++
	   enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; 
	   // To access, you'd need Color::RED, Color::GREEN, Color::BLUE.
	```
        
2.  **Implicit Conversion**:
    
    -   **enum**: Can be implicitly converted to an integer.
        
        cppCopy code
    ```c++
        enum Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE }; 
        int myColor = RED;  
        // This is valid.
	```

        
    -   **enum class**: Cannot be implicitly converted to an integer. Explicit casting is required.
        
        cppCopy code
    ```c++
    enum class Color { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
    int myColor = static_cast<int>(Color::RED);
    // Explicit casting needed.
	```
       
        
3.  **Underlying Type**:
    
    -   **enum**: By default, the underlying type might be `int`, but it's not guaranteed. You cannot directly specify the underlying type for it.
    -   **enum class**: You can specify an underlying type for it.
        
    ```c++
    enum class Color : char { RED, GREEN, BLUE };
      // Using char as the underlying type.
	```
        
        
4.  **Strong Typing**:
    -   **enum**: Not strongly typed. You might inadvertently assign a value of one enum type to a variable of another enum type.
    -   **enum class**: Strongly typed. You're not allowed to assign a value of one enum class to a variable of another enum class.
