In template code, you often deal with types that are dependent on template parameters. In your example, `T::SubType` is a dependent type because it depends on the type `T`. Without knowing what `T` actually is, the compiler cannot determine if `T::SubType` is a type or a static member variable of `T`.
    
**Potential Ambiguity**: Consider the hypothetical statement:
    
    T::SubType * ptr;
    
Without `typename`, the compiler might interpret this as a multiplication operation: `T::SubType` (a static member of `T`) multiplied by a variable named `ptr`.

    
**Using typename**: By prefixing `T::SubType` with `typename`:
    
    `typename T::SubType * ptr;`
    
 You are explicitly telling the compiler, "Hey, `T::SubType` is a type, not a static member variable!" This clears up any ambiguity.
    
**What happens if you omit typename**: If you don't use `typename` where it's required, the compiler will throw an error when you try to instantiate the template.
    
**Exceptions**: Not every dependent type needs the `typename` keyword. For instance, if the type is mentioned in a base class list or if it's used to define a new type with `typedef` or `using`, you don't need `typename`.
