`bimap` is a special container that allows users to access data in two ways, meaning you can think of it as a combination of two maps: one from key to value and another from value to key. This means you can conveniently look up the value corresponding to a key as well as the key corresponding to a value.

The `boost::bimap` container in the Boost library provides this functionality.

In the code snippet you provided:

cppCopy code

`auto it = names.right.find(s);`

This line is searching for `s` in the `right` map (i.e., the map from value to key). This means that if `s` is found, then `it->first` would be `s`, and `it->second` would be the corresponding key.

When you search in the left map (from key to value), `it->first` would be the key and `it->second` would be the value. However, when searching in the right map, they are the opposite.

Thus, in your code, `it->second` correctly returns the key associated with the string `s`.
